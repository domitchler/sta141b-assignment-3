The most recent estimates are based on a 2013 survey of US retail stores. We've cleaned and merged the fruit and vegetable price estimates for you. The result is the `fresh.csv` file included in the repository.\n",

    "In this assignment, you'll combine the price estimates with nutrition data from the [USDA Food Composition Databases](https://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/search/list), and then analyze the resulting dataset.\n",

    "The USDA Food Composition Databases have a [documented](https://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/doc/index) web API that returns data in JSON format . You need a key in order to use the API. Only 1000 requests are allowed per hour, so it's a good idea to use caching.\n",
